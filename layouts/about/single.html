                Dewi Ria Utari is a writer with two decades background in journalism in Indonesia, having worked for
                various Indonesia media outlets. She also served as a non-fiction editor at Gramedia Pustaka Utama,
                one of Indonesia's largest publishing houses. Dewi also frequently writes essays and criticism in
                the field of performing arts, which led her to receive a grant from the Asian Cultural Council in
                New York in 2007 to research performing arts archiving systems at the Lincoln Center Art Library.
                She was also appointed to represent Indonesia at the Asian-European dance critics' meeting during
                the International Dance Festival Ireland in Dublin in May 2004. Later, she received an invitation
                from the Theater Instituut Nederland to attend the Dance Festival in Maastricht in October 2004.

                Alongside her journalism career, Dewi developed her craft in fiction writing. Her first short story,

                and Kompas' Best Short Stories 2007. Her story "Perbatasan" (Borderline) was also selected for the
                20 Best Short Stories of the 2009 Pena Kencana Literary Award. Other notable works include "Ibu

                adaptation into a short film in 2025.

                for the <span class="font-medium text-brand-black">Khatulistiwa Literary Award 2010</span>. She has

                Malam" (And Then Came the Night) (2018).
            </p>

            <p>
                Beyond fiction, Dewi has also worked as a <span class="font-medium text-brand-black">ghostwriter</span>
                on several writing projects, including
                two books for a socialite and public figure Anita Chairul Tanjung—"Pesona Solo" (The Charm of Solo)
                and "Pesona Indonesia" (The Charm of Indonesia)—as well as two educational books for the
                Jakarta-based state-owned company PT MRT Jakarta, titled "Menjaga Laju Ratangga, Membangun Budaya
                Mewujudkan Layanan Berkelas Dunia" (Maintaining Ratangga's Momentum: Building a Culture of
                World-Class Service) and "TOD: Ratangga dan Wajah Baru Jakarta" (Transit-Oriented Development:
