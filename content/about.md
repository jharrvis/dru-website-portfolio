Dewi Ria Utari is a writer with two decades background in journalism in Indonesia, having worked for various Indonesia media outlets. She also served as a non-fiction editor at Gramedia Pustaka Utama, one of Indonesia's largest publishing houses. Dewi also frequently writes essays and criticism in the field of performing arts, which led her to receive a grant from the Asian Cultural Council in New York in 2007 to research performing arts archiving systems at the Lincoln Center Art Library. She was also appointed to represent Indonesia at the Asian-European dance critics' meeting during the International Dance Festival Ireland in Dublin in May 2004. Later, she received an invitation from the Theater Instituut Nederland to attend the Dance Festival in Maastricht in October 2004.

Alongside her journalism career, Dewi developed her craft in fiction writing. Her first short story, "Rumah Hujan" (The Rain House), was published in **Harian Kompas** and selected for **Kompas' Best Short Stories 2005-2006**. Several of her works have received literary recognition. Her short story "Sinai" was included in both the 20 Best Short Stories of the 2008 Pena Kencana Literary Award and Kompas' Best Short Stories 2007. Her story "Perbatasan" (Borderline) was also selected for the 20 Best Short Stories of the 2009 Pena Kencana Literary Award. Other notable works include "Ibu Pulang" (Mother Returns) in Kompas' Best Short Stories 2012, and "Angin Kita" (Our Wind) in Kompas' Best Short Stories 2013. Her 2018 story, **"Melarung Bapak" (Casting Father to Sea), was optioned by Rekata Film Studio (Kompas Gramedia Group) for adaptation into a short film in 2025**.

In 2009, Dewi published her first short story collection, "Kekasih Marionette dan 12 Kisah Lainnya" (The Marionette's Lover and 12 Other Stories), with Gramedia Pustaka Utama. The book was shortlisted for the **Khatulistiwa Literary Award 2010**. She has since continued her literary career by publishing several works, including the novel "Rumah Hujan" (2016), the young adult novel "The Swan" (2010), the short story collection "Di Dalam Hutan Entah di Mana" (In a Forest Somewhere) (2017), and the poetry and short story collection "Dan Datanglah Malam" (And Then Came the Night) (2018).

Beyond fiction, Dewi has also worked as a ghostwriter on several writing projects, including two books for a socialite and public figure Anita Chairul Tanjung—"Pesona Solo" (The Charm of Solo) and "Pesona Indonesia" (The Charm of Indonesia)—as well as two educational books for the Jakarta-based state-owned company PT MRT Jakarta, titled "Menjaga Laju Ratangga, Membangun Budaya Mewujudkan Layanan Berkelas Dunia" (Maintaining Ratangga's Momentum: Building a Culture of World-Class Service) and "TOD: Ratangga dan Wajah Baru Jakarta" (Transit-Oriented Development: Ratangga and Jakarta's New Face).

In addition to her writing career, Dewi is also a communications and literacy practitioner.
