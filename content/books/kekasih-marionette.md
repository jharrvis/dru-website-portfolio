This short story collection consists of thirteen stories written by Dewi Ria Utari between 2003 and 2009, all of which were previously published in various print media in Indonesia, including *Kompas*, *Koran Tempo*, *Media Indonesia*, *Suara Merdeka*, *Spice Magazine*, *Djakarta Magazine*, and *A+ Magazine*. As such, this book also marks a period when literary sections flourished in Indonesian mass media—before they gradually disappeared one by one.

The story *Marionette*, which lends its title to the book, is a combination of two short stories: *Kekasih*, published in *Djakarta Magazine* (February 2003), and *Marionette*, published in *Kompas* (Sunday, May 1, 2005). Both *Kekasih* and *Marionette* explore the perspectives and emotional landscapes of women navigating the pressures of urban life. Likewise, most of the other stories unravel the social pressures faced by women in society through a surrealist style—a conscious choice by Dewi to frame her narratives as dark fables of the lives of urban Indonesian women.

*Kekasih Marionette* was selected as one of the **Top Five titles of the Khatulistiwa Literary Award**, which later became the **Kusala Literary Award** in 2014.
