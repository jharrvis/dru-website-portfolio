Night does more than usher in the drowsiness that carries us toward lulling dreams. It often delivers us instead to the shadows we have long ignored—figures that inhabit our darkest nightmares.

In this collection of short stories and poems, Dewi Ria Utari collaborates with artist Yulian Ardhi, whose illustrations breathe a haunting visual life into the work. Through this union of words and images, the book offers a surreal, nonlinear experience of mystery—one that pulls readers into ragged fragments of unease, reminding them of the subconscious dreams they have tried, time and again, to bury deep within themselves.
