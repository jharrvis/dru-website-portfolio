"You have to support my opinion when we get home later. Don't forget."

My eldest sister's voice lodged itself inside my head and stayed there, even as I dozed off during the 16-hour-45-minute flight from Prague to Jakarta. It was useless trying to knock myself out with the white and red wines I kept asking the flight attendants for. Every time sleep and alcohol began to weigh down my eyelids, her voice buzzed in my ears, endlessly, pushing my anxiety to the edge and managing to distract me from the fact that Father had died.

Father died. I received the text on WhatsApp while I was drinking a Velkopopovický Kozel in a small bar on Kozy Street. I hurriedly paid for the three large glasses I had emptied and called my sister who sent the message. I agreed to her suggestion that I immediately book a flight home and asked when Father would be buried. "We'll wait until everyone's home. You're the only one who's far away. While waiting for you, I'll discuss Father's burial with our other sisters. If they're still stubborn, remember—you must support me," she said in a firm, pressing tone.

"Oh God, what are you all fighting about now?" I snapped, annoyed. I had already guessed this would come up.
